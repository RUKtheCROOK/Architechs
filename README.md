The read me section for my project:
# Architechs
Description: The website was initially intended to allow users to be able to post a project to be bid on by other users/teams to find a team for the project at the cheapest possible price. I wanted to also have some news that would be added by admins on the home page and then a feed page that users could use to make post and share their work and show their like for others works.Finally I wanted a messaging page where users would be able to send other users messages and recieve messages from other users.

Functionality that is working: The website is able to allow users to sign up and login and logout. The users are able to post projects to be bid on and view other users projects to be bid on. Users are able to bid on projects. The users are also able to make feed posts. The users are able to like other users feed posts. After looking back I do think that I couldve added comments to feed posts realtivley easily, however that is not a functional capability at this moment. The users are able to view the bidding page and bid history and view the feed. The users are able to send messages to other users and recieve messages from other users.

The technologies that I used were: React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Axios, Flask, Python, Certifi, and Pymongo.

The steps to run the project are: do 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Then npm start to start the front end. Then do a virtual environment and pip install flask, flask-cors, and flask-pymongo. Then run the server using 'py server.py' and the project should be running.
